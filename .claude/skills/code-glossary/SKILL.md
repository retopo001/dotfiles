description: Extract a clean command sequence and glossary from a conversation. Use when the user asks to summarize instructions, extract commands, or create a reference from a discussion.

Extract from this conversation: (1) a strictly ordered, minimal list of all commands, code snippets, configuration lines, or procedural instructions that were suggested or implied, rewritten as a clean linear sequence with no commentary, duplication, or conversational artifacts; and (2) a concise glossary defining every command, function, file, tool, concept, or term referenced in those instructions, including what each item is, what role it plays, and — where applicable — the meaning of all arguments, flags, switches, parameters, or options. If any term depends on jargon, metaphorical naming, historical conventions, or assumed background knowledge, explicitly explain it in precise, plain technical language.
