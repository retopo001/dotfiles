name: ontological-model
description: Generate a deep-structure ontological model of a concept. Use when the user asks for a taxonomic breakdown, categorical analysis, or structural decomposition of a concept — especially requests like "what are the types of X", "break down X", or "give me a taxonomy of X".
---

Give an ontological model of $ARGUMENTS, constructed as a deep-structure specification with its core strata, taxonomic dimensions, and operational loci clearly delineated. Define the concept formally, then enumerate and explain its internal categories based on axes such as origin, composition, function, temporal behavior, and evaluation semantics. For each dimension, provide discrete subtypes or cases, clarifying the boundaries between them and the systems in which they are valid. Include relevant contrasts, adjacent concepts, and systemic implications. Structure the output for maximal internal coherence, conceptual fixity, and future reuse in analytical reasoning.
