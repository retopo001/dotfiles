Intro
t-mux is perhaps the one piece of
software that's had the biggest impact
on the way I write code out of the box
however tmux can be difficult to look at
it requires a little bit of
configuration to really get productive
with in this video I'm going to explain
why tmux is so powerful and show you how
to update it from its default offering
into a version that is modern zenful and
a joy to work with
Why Tmux?
I really meant it when I said that tmux
has had one of the biggest impacts to
the way I write code before discovering
it I worked more with Ides and graphical
editors and only entered the terminal
when I needed to once I discovered tmux
however that all changed my default
editor became them and I was able to
have all of the goodness of a tiling
window manager in the terminal tmux also
provides other features for working in a
command line that I just can't live
without using tmux I can create and
manage new windows for multiple terminal
sessions
split a window into panes so that I can
have multiple sessions in one View
prevent my workspace from being lost if
my terminal crashes or more likely if I
accidentally close it and if I just want
to do my favorite nighttime activity bed
coding I can pick up my laptop SSH into
my desktop and attach into my previous
tmug session tmux really has improved
the way I work and over the years I've
built up a configuration that works
really well for me which I want to share
with you today
Getting started
as usual we'll need to do a little work
before we can start writing our zenful
configuration
the first step is to make sure you have
tmux installed as of the time of
recording the latest version is 3.3 a
huh weird anyway get that installed as
per your operating system
next you're going to need the tmux
package manager also known as TPM this
is installed using git so make sure you
have that as well
to install the tmux package manager you
can run the following command to do so
now let's go ahead and create our tmug
stop file you can do this at either the
home.tmux.com or the xdg config home
Teamworks gmux.conf which typically
translates to home.config tmux tmox conf
whichever place you prefer
ly I'm going to go with the xdg config
as it's the more modern way to manage
dot files
next open up your fresh config file in
your favorite editor and add in the
following lines to Source the TPM
package and to run it whilst we're here
we're also going to add in the sensible
package which basically sets a number of
options that fix some of the quirks with
tmux based configuration if you want to
know more about what options this
package changes I recommend heading over
to the GitHub page and reading their
documentation
with our initial config set we can go
ahead and run tmux to load it if you're
already in tmux you can reload the
configuration by calling the tmux source
command to Source our new configuration
file and that's it now we have a package
manager for tmux and some sensible
options to get started with
How to use Tmux
before we jump into configuring tmux
it's probably worth going over some of
the basic commands and key bindings for
using it
tmux consists of three main objects
sessions windows and panes
sessions are the topmost layer in tmux
and are a collection of one or more
windows managed as a single unit you can
have any number of sessions open at one
time but typically only attached to one
each session has a single active window
s are a container to one or more panes
you can think of Windows as tabs in
browsers or other software each window
has a currently active Pane and allows
you to switch between any of the panes
that it manages
the windows in the session are shown at
the bottom of the screen as well as
which window is currently active as
marked with an asterisk
panes are splits in the window and
represent an individual terminal session
there will only be one active pane at a
time that you'll interact with
in this window I have three panes which
have been created by splitting the
window horizontally and vertically my
current active pane is the one on the
left which I can enter commands into
enter commands to tmux you need to use
What's called the prefix key this is a
key combination that you use before the
actual command itself the default prefix
is control and B
to create a new window you press the
prefix followed by the c key as well as
creating the new window this command
will also set it as your current active
window for the session to change between
Windows we pass the prefix and the
window number which is shown at the
bottom or we can cycle through windows
by pressing the prefix followed by
either the N or P keys which stand for
next and previous respectively
we can also move Windows around by using
the swap window command which is done so
by pressing the prefix and then entering
the command which starts with a colon
to close a window you can either kill
all the panes inside or use the prefix
followed by the Ampersand symbol
there are also a number of commands to
manage panes in tmux we can split a
window into panes either horizontally or
vertically to split a window
horizontally we use the prefix followed
by the percentage symbol which will
split our current pane into two
to split vertically is the prefix key
followed by the quotation mark symbol
panes can be navigated by using the
prefix followed by one of the arrow keys
to whichever direction you wish
we can also swap panes around by using
the prefix followed by the left or right
brace symbol
panes also have numbers which you can
toggle by using the prefix followed by Q
we can then select a pane by pressing
the subsequent number when this is shown
one of the features I use often is
zooming into a pane to make it take up
the full window this can be done with
the prefix followed by the Z key
Additionally you can turn a pane into a
window by using the prefix and
exclamation point
to close a pane you can either close the
shell that is running or use the prefix
followed by the X key
as well as panes and windows we should
also quickly cover sessions a new
session can be created by using the tmux
command whilst not attached to a current
tmux session this will create the new
session and attach you to it you can
also pass in the S argument to the tmox
new command to create a new session with
a name
whilst in tmux a new session can be
created using the new command
we can list any active sessions we have
using the tmux ls command when outside
of tmox or by pressing the prefix
followed by the S key when inside of a
session
you can also use the prefix followed by
W key to preview windows for each
session as well and attach to these
sessions by pressing enter
finally to attach when outside of a
session you can use the tmux attach
command which will attach to your most
recent session or you can pass in the T
argument to specify which session you
want to attach to
this covers a lot of the basic commands
for tmox but there are plenty of others
I recommend looking at tmux cheat
sheet.com for some of the other commands
that I haven't covered after that brief
overview we can now look at our
configuration
Better Navigation
after installing the package manager the
first thing I like to do is set up some
better key bindings for navigating
around tmux
I like to use a package called Vim tmux
Navigator which actually provides us two
features the first is the ability to
move around split panes and tmux using
control and either the h j k or L Keys
similar to what I have in my near them
configuration which by the way I'd
recommend checking out if you haven't
already
the second feature this package provides
is that we can use it to have seamless
integration with both tmux and neovim by
also installing it as a neovim plugin
let's go ahead and do both
adding it to neovim is the same as how
you would install any plugin as I'm
using nvchat I just need to add the
plugin to my Customs plugin file I'll
also set lazy to be false as this is
likely going to always be needed I also
had to add in some custom mappings in
order to override the ones that nvchad
sets which override the Vim tmux
navigation settings
a little annoying but nothing we can't
fix
now if we go ahead to our tmux config we
can add the Vim tmux navigator to our
tmux plugins and then install it by
using the prefix key control B and
capital i
if we then go and Source our tmux
configuration we are able to Now
navigate using the control plus h j k or
L keys what's really powerful is this
also works whilst we're in near them so
we can easily move out any of them into
tmux with one of the same keys this
helps to make tmux and near them work as
if they were one application as well as
these vimkey bindings I like to add in
some custom mappings for navigating
Windows as well
back in our tmux config adding in the
following lines allows us to cycle
across windows by using the shift plus
alt and either the H or L key
Colors
one thing we also need to do is fix our
colors when we're inside of a tmux
session
if you look at our cat poochie neovim
theme the colors are different when
we're inside of tmux versus when we're
not
we can fix this by opening up our tmux
config and setting the following line
this sets tmux to be 24-bit color
provided that your terminal supports it
now when we restart tmux and open up
them again we can see that our colors
are correct
Prefix key
so far we've kept the default prefix key
binding of control and B for use with
tmux however this binding tends to be
used for other functionality in the
terminal
because of this I like to change the
tmux prefix to be control space instead
to change the prefix all you need to do
is add the following three lines into
your tmus configuration and set where
your desired prefix key combination is
which in my case is controlling space
now when you resource the config your
prefix key should be changed
Theme
finally it's time to get rid of that
horrible green line if you've watched my
other videos then you'll know that
Capuchin is my favorite color scheme
what's really nice is that Capuchin
provides a plug-in for tmux as well
which we can install using TPM to
install it just add the plugin to your
tmos configuration and then type in the
prefix followed by capital i
as well as the default color scheme
which is called mocker you can change
this to any of the other three variants
by setting the Capuchin flavor variable
here is the light variant known as latte
I actually have my own Fork of Capuchin
as I prefer to have a little more
information on my window tabs than just
the directory name which is what the
official cap routine package is
configured for to use my version you
just need to change the following line
in your TMax config
Mouse Support
the next feature I like to add to tmux
is the ability to use the mouse by
adding the following line to our config
we can enable mouse support which means
we're able to click to jump to Windows
or panes and use our Mouse wheel to
scroll through our buffer history
Window numbering
by default tmux starts indexing of
windows at zero whilst this makes sense
from a coding point of view in practice
it's a bit of an issue this is because
the zero key is all the way to the right
on a keyboard which makes it
counter-intuitive for navigation and
tmux by setting the following lines in
our tmox config and restarting tmux we
can start the indexing for Windows and
panes at one which is a better user
experience
Yanking
another package that I find makes the
tmox experience more productive is the
tmux yank package which provides the
ability to copy text from tmux using the
y key
we can add this package to tmux by
adding the following line to our
configuration and installing it via TPM
now we can copy lines from our buffer
history by selecting the line and
pressing the y key to select a line you
can either do so with the mouse or by
entering copy mode which is through
pressing the prefix key followed by the
left square bracket we can then navigate
by using the Vim navigation keys and
entering the select mode by typing
Control Plus V followed by space
then you use the navigation keys to
define the area to copy
personally I find this command set a
little encumbersome so let's rebind this
flow to be more intuitive and Vim like
first add the following lines to your
config and then resource the tmux config
file
now going back to copy mode instead we
can press V to start the copy selection
as we expect and press the y key to
yankar selection
we can also toggle between rectangle
select or line select mode by pressing
Ctrl MV
Current working directory
the final configuration change I like to
make is to set my panes to open in the
same directory as the pane I'm splitting
from I typically find this workflow to
be more productive as I usually navigate
to this directory in most cases anyway
and it's typically easier to navigate
back to the home directory than it is to
the directory I'm currently working in
we can do this by adding the following
lines to the tmux config which rebinds
both the horizontal and vertical split
pane keys to add the current path to the
split command
now after sourcing our changes whenever
we press the prefix and percent sign or
the prefix and quotation mark commands
we should open up new panes in our
current working directory and with that
you now have a tmux configuration that
is both productive and a joy to work
with I hope this video inspired you to
try Teamworks yourself or to upgrade
your existing configuration as usual a
git repo to my configuration can be
found in the description and if you know
any other plugins that you think should
be in there let me know in the comments
down below
otherwise thank you for watching and
I'll see you on the next one
